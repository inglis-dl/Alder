A list of things which need to be done (in no particular order)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- add an image atlas (ie: a way for a user to view expert ratings)
- consider opening exam tree and displaying same exam type during next/prev operations
- add const expressions where possible (including const_iterator)
- whole body dexa scans have two different "exam types"
- consider overloading native operators in active record class
- make parent class for QAlder*Widget
