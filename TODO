A list of things which need to be done (in no particular order)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- consider opening exam tree and displaying same exam type during next/prev operations
- add const expressions where possible (including const_iterator)
- minimize lag time between login dialog closing and interview widget populating with last image
- add way to put installed config.xml file in /etc/alder
