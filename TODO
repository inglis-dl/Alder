A list of things which need to be done (in no particular order)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- add an image atlas (ie: a way for a user to view expert ratings)
- add option in CMake chain to create initial database
- add const expressions where possible (includeing const_iterator)
- make error when no modalities exist user-friendly
- consider overloading native operators in active record class
- consider passing control of viewer widgets to atlas and interview widgets
