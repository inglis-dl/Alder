A list of things which need to be done (in no particular order)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- add const expressions where possible (including const_iterator)
- minimize lag time between login dialog closing and interview widget populating with last image
- add way for user to change password
- consider adding a modal-less text display window to monitor and scroll the log 
- consider changing Exam.Downloaded from a t/f to an enum status: {EMPTY, PARTIAL, COMPLETE}
